Memory usage is considerably lower and many more images can be loaded in\nsequence without having to worry\nCloses https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/2008\nGithub Author: Adam Roth <adamjroth@gmail.com>", "repo_description": null, "generate_at": "2015-07-21 05:39:57.000-07:00", "author_id": 542, "repo_name": "hunter524/StudyReactNativeSrc"}, {"repo_id": 25507093, "repo_owner_id": 160702, "commit_at": "2014-10-21 01:52:11-05:00", "committer_id": null, "message": "Import of AROTH/Image-Magick-Info-0.03 from CPAN.\n\ngitpan-cpan-distribution: Image-Magick-Info\ngitpan-cpan-version:      0.03\ngitpan-cpan-path:         AROTH/Image-Magick-Info-0.03.tar.gz\ngitpan-cpan-author:       AROTH\ngitpan-cpan-maturity:     released", "repo_description": "Read-only release history for Image-Magick-Info", "generate_at": "2005-08-05 15:18:49Z", "author_id": 542, "repo_name": "gitpan/Image-Magick-Info"}, {"repo_id": 25507093, "repo_owner_id": 160702, "commit_at": "2014-10-21 01:52:11-05:00", "committer_id": null, "message": "Import of AROTH/Image-Magick-Info-0.02 from CPAN.\n\ngitpan-cpan-distribution: Image-Magick-Info\ngitpan-cpan-version:      0.02\ngitpan-cpan-path:         AROTH/Image-Magick-Info-0.02.tar.gz\ngitpan-cpan-author:       AROTH\ngitpan-cpan-maturity:     released", "repo_description": "Read-only release history for Image-Magick-Info", "generate_at": "2005-08-05 04:44:43Z", "author_id": 542, "repo_name": "gitpan/Image-Magick-Info"}, {"repo_id": 25507093, "repo_owner_id": 160702, "commit_at": "2014-10-21 01:52:11-05:00", "committer_id": null, "message": "Import of AROTH/Image-Magick-Info-0.01 from CPAN.\n\ngitpan-cpan-distribution: Image-Magick-Info\ngitpan-cpan-version:      0.01\ngitpan-cpan-path:         AROTH/Image-Magick-Info-0.01.tar.gz\ngitpan-cpan-author:       AROTH\ngitpan-cpan-maturity:     released", "repo_description": "Read-only release history for Image-Magick-Info", "generate_at": "2005-05-05 14:58:20Z", "author_id": 542, "repo_name": "gitpan/Image-Magick-Info"}, {"repo_id": 25507093, "repo_owner_id": 160702, "commit_at": "2014-10-21 01:52:11-05:00", "committer_id": null, "message": "Import of AROTH/Image-Magick-Info-0.0.1 from CPAN.\n\ngitpan-cpan-distribution: Image-Magick-Info\ngitpan-cpan-version:      0.0.1\ngitpan-cpan-path:         AROTH/Image-Magick-Info-0.0.1.tar.gz\ngitpan-cpan-author:       AROTH\ngitpan-cpan-maturity:     released", "repo_description": "Read-only release history for Image-Magick-Info", "generate_at": "2005-05-04 18:50:08Z", "author_id": 542, "repo_name": "gitpan/Image-Magick-Info"}, {"repo_id": 48333892, "repo_owner_id": 542, "commit_at": "2016-11-24 21:05:49-05:00", "committer_id": 19864447, "message": "Updated README.md usage example code.", "repo_description": "A React Native module to upload files and camera roll assets.", "generate_at": "2016-11-24 21:05:49-05:00", "author_id": 542, "repo_name": "aroth/react-native-uploader"}, {"repo_id": 48333892, "repo_owner_id": 542, "commit_at": "2016-11-24 20:57:56-05:00", "committer_id": 542, "message": "Bump version to 0.10: upgrade to react-native 0.38, update UploadFromCameraRoll sample app.", "repo_description": "A React Native module to upload files and camera roll assets.", "generate_at": "2016-11-24 20:57:56-05:00", "author_id": 542, "repo_name": "aroth/react-native-uploader"}, {"repo_id": 48333892, "repo_owner_id": 542, "commit_at": "2016-09-08 22:53:31-04:00", "committer_id": 19864447, "message": "Merge pull request #14 from hypatiah/master\n\nInclude shorcuts to link native modules", "repo_description": "A React Native module to upload files and camera roll assets.", "generate_at": "2016-09-08 22:53:31-04:00", "author_id": 542, "repo_name": "aroth/react-native-uploader"}, {"repo_id": 48333892, "repo_owner_id": 542, "commit_at": "2016-03-23 08:54:56-04:00", "committer_id": 542, "message": "Merge pull request #7 from bouchertommy/master\n\nAdding video upload support from ALAsset.", "repo_description": "A React Native module to upload files and camera roll assets.", "generate_at": "2016-03-23 08:54:56-04:00", "author_id": 542, "repo_name": "aroth/react-native-uploader"}, {"repo_id": 48333892, "repo_owner_id": 542, "commit_at": "2016-03-05 08:49:03-05:00", "committer_id": 542, "message": "release settings updated;

https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/1969\n\n--\nRecent improvements allow RCTImageLoader to select a more appropriate sized image based on the layout dimensions. Sizes:\n\n\t- asset.thumbnail\n\t- asset.aspectRatioThumbnail\n\t- asset.defaultRepresentation.fullScreenImage\n\t- asset.defaultRepresentation.fullResolutionImage\n\nPrior, only the fullResolutionImage was used. This was memory intensive and resulted in crashes when loading several large images at once.

The updated implementation works well, but can be made more efficient:\n\nConsider loading 10 8MP (3264x2448) images in 150x150 pixel containers. The target size (150x150) is larger than asset.thumbnail (approx 100x100), therefore the fullScreenImage representation is used instead (approx 1334x1000).\n\nThis commit will scale the asset to the minimum size required while taking into account original aspect ratio and device scale. Memory usage is considerably lower and many more images can be loaded in\nsequence without having to worry\nCloses https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/2008\nGithub Author: Adam Roth <adamjroth@gmail.com>", "repo_description": "WebviewTesting", "generate_at": "2015-07-21 05:39:57-07:00", "author_id": 542, "repo_name": "yong076/webviewtesting"}], "bio": null, "commits": 286, "company": null, "following_list": [8213, 8899, 13777, 15000, 90494, 156825, 272404, 291754, 306324, 1005377, 1792087, 10623014], "public_gists": 1, "name": "A Roth", "created_at": "2008-02-20 22:59:12", "email": null, "following": 12, "login": "aroth", "repo_list": [{"fork": true, "license": null, "has_wiki": true, "description": "An ActiveRecord plugin for managing lists.", "language": "Ruby", "default_branch": "master", "created_at": "2012-06-26 23:14:44", "forks_count": 0, "updated_at": "2016-09-20 12:07:04", "pushed_at": "2012-06-26 23:18:14", "full_name": "aroth/acts_as_list", "open_issues": 0, "stargazers_count": 1, "owner_id": 542, "id": 4801769, "size": 145}, {"fork": true, "license": "MIT License", "has_wiki": true, "description": "Makes Amazon S3 backups redonkulous.
